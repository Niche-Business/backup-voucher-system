# BAK UP E-Voucher System: Schools & Care Organizations Feature Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the new **Schools & Care Organizations** feature in the BAK UP E-Voucher System. It covers the functionality from both the administrator and school perspectives, including account creation, fund allocation, and voucher issuance.

## 1. Administrator Workflow

The administrator has the ability to manage schools and allocate funds to them through the Admin Portal.

### 1.1. Viewing Registered Schools

Administrators can view a list of all registered schools and care organizations by navigating to the **Schools/Care Orgs** tab in the Admin Portal. This provides a clear overview of all participating institutions.

Each school is displayed as a card with the following information:
- Contact Person
- Email Address
- Phone Number
- Address
- Allocated Balance

### 1.2. Allocating Funds to Schools

Administrators can allocate funds to schools from the **Overview** tab. The process is as follows:

1.  Select **School/Care Organization** from the **Organization Type** dropdown.
2.  Choose the desired school from the **Select School/Care Organization** dropdown.
3.  Enter the amount to be allocated in the **Amount (£)** field.
4.  (Optional) Add any relevant notes in the **Notes (Optional)** field.
5.  Click the **💸 Allocate Funds** button to complete the allocation.

The school's allocated balance will be updated immediately.

## 2. School/Care Organization Workflow

Schools and care organizations have their own dedicated portal to manage their allocated funds and issue vouchers to families in need.

### 2.1. Account Registration

Schools can create an account by following these steps:

1.  Click the **Create Account** button on the homepage.
2.  Select **School/Care Organization** from the **User Type** dropdown.

4.  Click the **Register** button to create the account.

### 2.2. School Dashboard

Upon logging in, schools are directed to their dashboard, which provides an overview of their activities. The dashboard includes:

-   **Available Balance:** The total amount of funds allocated by the administrator.
-   **Statistics:** Key metrics such as the total number of vouchers issued, active vouchers, and redeemed vouchers.
-   **Tabs:**
    -   **Overview:** The main dashboard view.
    -   **Issue Vouchers:** A form to issue new e-vouchers to families.
    -   **Voucher History:** A record of all previously issued vouchers.

### 2.3. Issuing E-Vouchers

Schools can issue e-vouchers to families directly from their dashboard:

1.  Navigate to the **Issue Vouchers** tab.
2.  Fill in the recipient family's details (name, email, phone, address).
3.  Enter the desired voucher amount.
4.  Click the **Issue Voucher** button.

The voucher amount will be deducted from the school's available balance.
