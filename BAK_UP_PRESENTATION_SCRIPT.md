## Slide 1: Title Slide

**(Visual):** Clean background with the BAK UP logo.

**(Presenter):** "Good morning, Prince. Thank you for your time today. We are thrilled to present the fully enhanced BAK UP E-Voucher System, which now incorporates all of your valuable feedback. Our goal today is to walk you through these updates and demonstrate how the platform directly aligns with your vision for a community-driven solution to food insecurity and waste."

---

## Slide 2: Agenda

**(Visual):** A simple list of topics.

**(Presenter):** "We'll start by revisiting the core vision you shared, particularly the new 'Food to Go at a discount' concept. Then, we'll do a live walkthrough of the updated platform, covering the new landing page and the distinct user journeys for Recipients, Vendors, VCSE Organizations, and the secure role of the Administrator. Finally, we'll summarize the key enhancements and discuss the next steps."

## Slide 3: Your Vision, Implemented

**(Visual):** A blockquote with the client's key feedback.

> "The idea here is to get local vendors to sell at a discount for those individuals who have an account--- before giving any surplus for charitable organisation to collect and distribute to the families they serve."

**(Presenter):** "This was the guiding principle for all the recent enhancements. We understood the need for a dual system that empowers recipients with choice and dignity while also enabling charitable distribution. We've built the platform around this core concept: a marketplace for discounted food, running in parallel with a system for free surplus collection by VCSEs."

## Slide 4: Live Demo - The Landing Page

**(Action):** Navigate to the live application URL: `https://8080-ierehl7kwb22jfpoqfics-fc37dde3.manusvm.computer/`

**(Presenter):** "Let's start with the first thing users will see. As you can see, the landing page has been updated to reflect this new, dual approach. Right here, in the 'Surplus Food Sharing' section, the text now reads exactly as you requested..."

**(Action):** Point to the updated text.

**(Presenter):** "...*'Vendors can post surplus food items for families as discount and free food surplus to VCSE partners to support the families they serve, reducing food waste.'* We've also reorganized the 'Who We Serve' section to make the roles crystal clear."

**(Action):** Scroll down to the 'Who We Serve' section.

**(Presenter):** "For Recipients, we now highlight the **'Food to Go at a discount'** feature. For VCSE Organizations, the focus is on their ability to **'Collect free surplus food'**. This ensures the messaging is perfectly aligned with the platform's functionality from the very first interaction."

## Slide 5: User Journey 1 - The Recipient

**(Visual):** An icon representing a family or individual.

**(Presenter):** "Now, let's explore the system from the perspective of a Recipient. After a simple and secure registration, they land on their personal dashboard."

**(Action):** Log in using the `recipient.test@bakup.org` account.

**(Presenter):** "The Recipient Dashboard is now a hub of choice. They have three key tabs:

1.  **Your Vouchers:** Where they can see their available food vouchers.
2.  **Participating Shops:** A new tab showing a list of all vendors in the network, so they know where they can shop.
3.  **Browse Surplus Items:** This is the 'Food to Go at a discount' feature in action. Here, they can browse all items posted by vendors at a reduced price. They can see the item, the price, and which shop is offering it, empowering them to choose what they need."

## Slide 6: User Journey 2 - The Vendor

**(Visual):** An icon representing a local shop.

**(Presenter):** "Next, the Vendor. Vendors are the heart of this ecosystem. We've made it incredibly simple for them to participate in both programs."

**(Action):** Log out and log in as `vendor.test@bakup.org`.

**(Presenter):** "When a vendor posts a surplus item, they now have a crucial choice: Is this item for the **'Discount Program'** for recipients, or is it a **'Free Donation'** for VCSEs? This allows them to easily manage their inventory and contribute in a way that best suits their business. Their dashboard clearly shows the count of items they have posted, which we've confirmed is fully functional."

---

## Slide 7: User Journey 3 - The VCSE Organization

**(Visual):** An icon representing a charity or partnership.

**(Presenter):** "The role of the VCSE is now more focused and impactful. They are the logistical experts for charitable distribution."

**(Action):** Log out and log in as `vcse.test@bakup.org`.

**(Presenter):** "The VCSE dashboard allows them to manage their allocated funds and issue vouchers as before. But critically, they now have a view of all **'Free Surplus'** items available for collection. They can see what's available and from which vendor, allowing them to efficiently organize collection and distribution to the families they serve, completely separate from the recipient discount program."

---

## Slide 8: User Journey 4 - The Administrator (BAK UP's Role)

**(Visual):** An icon representing a control panel or system admin.

**(Presenter):** "Finally, let's look at the Administrator role, which is securely controlled by BAK UP. As you requested, we've removed the ability for anyone to publicly sign up as an admin. This is a key security enhancement."

**(Action):** Log out and log in with your admin credentials: `prince.caesar@bakup.org`.

**(Presenter):** "The Admin Portal provides a 360-degree view of the entire ecosystem. In addition to managing funds and users, you now have two powerful new tabs:

1.  **All Shops:** This gives you a complete directory of all participating vendors and a quick overview of their surplus activity.
2.  **All Surplus Items:** This is your master view. You can see every single item—both discount and free—posted across the entire platform. This is crucial for monitoring, reporting, and ensuring the system is healthy.

Furthermore, in the 'Voucher Management' tab, you can now see the **full details of the recipient** for every voucher, providing complete transparency."
