## 2. The Demonstration Walkthrough

### **Part 1: The Landing Page & Public Signup**

**(Action):** Start with your screen sharing the application's landing page.

**(Presenter Script):**
> "Welcome, [Client Name]. As you can see, we're on the live landing page of the BAK UP system. We've implemented all the text changes you requested, ensuring the messaging about the dual surplus programs is clear right from the start."

**(Action):** Scroll down to the "Who We Serve" section and point out the updated text for Recipients and VCSEs.

**(Presenter Script):**
> "Now, let's walk through the user registration process. We'll start by clicking the 'Get Started' or 'Create Account' button."

**(Action):** Click on "Get Started". You will be taken to the registration form.

**(Presenter Script):**
> "This is the public registration form for anyone wanting to join the BAK UP ecosystem. The first thing I want to draw your attention to is the 'User Type' dropdown menu."

**(Action):** Click the "User Type" dropdown.

**(Presenter Script):**
> "You'll notice there are three options here: **Recipient, Vendor, and VCSE Organization**. Based on your excellent feedback, we have deliberately **removed 'Administrator' from this list**. This is a critical security measure. It ensures that only authorized personnel, designated internally by BAK UP, can have administrative access. It prevents anyone from the public from attempting to create a privileged account."

**(Action):** To show the process works, quickly register a new test user.
*   Select "Recipient" as the User Type.
*   Fill in sample details (e.g., Test User, test.user@email.com, etc.).
*   Click "Register".

**(Presenter Script):**
> "Once a user registers, they are taken directly to the sign-in page, ready to access their new account. This entire flow is seamless for public users."

### **Part 2: The Secure Admin Login**

**(Action):** You should now be on the "Sign In" page.

**(Presenter Script):**
> "So, the key question is: how does an administrator access the system? Since they can't sign up, they must be provisioned with an account internally. This is how we created your personal admin account. Let me show you how you, as an administrator, would log in."

**(Action):**
1.  Enter **your** admin credentials:
    *   Email: `prince.caesar@bakup.org`
    *   Password: `Prince@2024`
2.  Click "Sign In".

**(Presenter Script):**
> "And just like that, you are in. Welcome to the Admin Portal. This dashboard is exclusively for you and other BAK UP administrators. From here, you have complete oversight of the entire system."

---

### **Part 3: Demonstrating the New Admin Features**

**(Action):** Your screen should now show the Admin Portal.

**(Presenter Script):**
> "Let me quickly highlight the new features we implemented based on your request for greater visibility."

1.  **(Action):** Click on the **"All Shops"** tab.
    **(Presenter Script):**
    > "First, the 'All Shops' tab. This gives you a master list of every vendor participating in the network, along with their contact details and a count of the surplus items they have posted."

2.  **(Action):** Click on the **"All Surplus Items"** tab.
    **(Presenter Script):**
    > "Next, the 'All Surplus Items' tab. This is your central hub for monitoring all food items in the system—both the discounted items for recipients and the free donations for VCSEs. You can see what the item is, its price or status, and which vendor posted it."

3.  **(Action):** Click on the **"Voucher Management"** tab.
    **(Presenter Script):**
    > "Finally, we've enhanced the 'Voucher Management' view. You can now see the **full details of the recipient** for every voucher issued, providing complete transparency and traceability."

## 3. Concluding the Demonstration

**(Action):** Navigate back to the main Admin "Overview" tab.

**(Presenter Script):**
> "So, to summarize: we have a public-facing registration for Recipients, Vendors, and VCSEs, and a separate, secure method for creating Administrator accounts, ensuring BAK UP maintains full control. Once logged in, you have powerful new tools to oversee the entire ecosystem.

> This structure provides the perfect balance of accessibility for your community and security for your organization.

> Are there any parts of this process you'd like to see again or any questions I can answer?"

### **Key Talking Points to Emphasize:**

*   **Security:** Mention that separating the admin signup is a "security best practice" that protects the integrity of the platform.
*   **Control:** Frame it as BAK UP having "full control" and "oversight" over its administrators.
*   **Clarity:** Explain that this makes the user journey clearer and safer for everyone.
*   **Your Access:** Reassure the client that their personal admin account (`prince.caesar@bakup.org`) is fully functional and was created using this secure internal process.
